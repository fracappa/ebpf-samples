# ebpf-samples

This repo contains various examples to learn, explore, and experiment with eBPF.

In this repo, I will add various eBPF examples. I'll start with simple ones and gradually add more complex examples. Some of the eBPF code may be adapted from well-known repositories.


Notes: 
* I'm using the [cilium/ebpf](https://github.com/cilium/ebpf) library. Maybe I'll add some example with libbpf.
* The headers used are taken from the same library.
